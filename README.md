# View SNP in 3D, or Find Symmetry of 3D Structure

## View SNP in 3D
iCn3D shows SNPs in the sequences. It will be interesting to show the mutated residues in 3D directly. We could use the leap program in AMBER, SCWRL, or other programs.

## Find Symmetry of 3D Structure
Find the symmetry of a structure (assembly,chain,domain) and display it in iCn3D. We could convert the source code of SYMM to a web service.
